# Kannada Phonetic Keyboard Sulekhanee

## Introduction

The Kannada Phonetic Keyboard Sulekhanee is a keyboard layout designed to enhance
Kannada typing speed and ease of use across various applications.

### Benefits

* Faster Typing:
Sulekhanee leverages familiar key combinations inspired by the 'Kagapa Nudi Kannada' layout, promoting faster and more efficient typing.
* Improved Accessibility:
Unlike the Nudi keyboard application, Sulekhanee functions seamlessly within all applications, including Microsoft Word and Excel.
* Wide Compatibility:
This keyboard layout is designed for easy access and functionality on various systems.
### Development Background
The Sulekhanee keyboard addresses limitations found in the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator.
While the Creator offers some level of phonetic mapping, it may not be as optimized as the Nudi keyboard.
However, the Nudi application itself faces compatibility issues with certain software.
### Future Enhancements
The Sulekhanee keyboard layout is under continuous development. We actively seek user feedback to implement modifications that further improve user convenience and typing experience.
